## Note :
Place your PHP files in the "HTDocs" folder located under the "XAMMP" folder on your C: drive. The file path is "C:\xampp\htdocs" for 
your Web server. Make sure your PHP files are saved as such; they must have the ".php" file extension. Open up any Web browser on your 
desktop and enter "localhost" into the address box. The browser will open a list of files stored under the "HTDocs" folder on your 
computer. Click on the link to a PHP file and open it to run a script.
